# Determining-Granger-Causal-Flow-for-GSPC-index-Summer-2019-to-2021-vs-Summer-2021-to-2023
This project saught to investigate the Granger Causality Strength within the S&P 500. For simplicity and for computation purposes the individual stocks were grouped by the sector which they belonged to thus leaving us with 11 groups composed of S&P 500 stocks (Summer 2019-Summer 2021 vs Summer 2021-Summer 2023). The overarching question was how these sectors interacted with one another through their Granger Causal Flow and just how different this would be between these two time periods. To accompish this the following steps were taken:
- 1. Compared the time series themselves in each time frame.
- 2. Compared sparsity structures using different methods.
- 3. Finally, compared the GC strength.
